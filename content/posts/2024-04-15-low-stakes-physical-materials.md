title: "Low-stakes physical materials"
---

Compared to digital constructions, there is a higher cost to starting over with physical work. But there are materials you can choose where it's much lower-stakes, and I've been having fun assembling a set of them:

- Cardboard: a standby of prototyping, easily cut, surprisingly sturdy, readily available from shipping boxes, if cardboard wasn't so ubiquitous it would be a lot more appreciated. I at least do a first version on most things in cardboard, and often it lasts long enough that it stays cardboard. Goes great with hot glue but usually I just use tape.
- Masking tape: good for cardboard, good for taping up inspiration, good for writing on with sharpie.
- Air-drying clay: this a new one. I've made some keyboard palm rests, a new housing for a wireless phone charger, and a holder for a set of cards. Not as nice looking as fired clay, it's still wonderful to be able to sit down with an idea and rough it out in 15 minutes. Clay gives you shapes cardboard and wood aren't friendly too.
- Velco - I've got rolls of velcro with adhesive on one side. Makes for easy keyboard and phone mounts.
- Monitor poles and arms: I've rearranged monitors so many times. Poles and the arms that go on them are generally modular and you can figure out ways to mount non-monitor things as well.  Most recently I used hose clamps to mount plywood panels flat against the poles. You can also get them in suprisingly tall sizes. If I were running a co-working space I'd make walls out of them.
- Plywood: wood requires a lot more tools and set-up. I've got a decent set now, but I still try and set some constraints to not get bogged down in perfectionism. I got four sheets of 3/4" birch from home depot a while ago, and they lasted me many years. Lately I've taken to breaking down old under-used projects and reusing the wood, feels surprisingly satisfying. I try and keep it simple. Cut into rectangular shapes, mostly hold together with wood glue -- screws when needed.
- Hinges and connector plates: with the plywood I've been venturing into hinges. Had a real "there are no rules" realization moment with the fact that you can just go buy hinges and make whatever kind of folding hinge-y thing you want. Starting to notice all the hinges around me.
- Fabric and sewing: I've done some bag modifications, often using the velcro. I think there's a lot more I could do here. Fabric, like clay, is a kind of differently shaped thing than cardboard and wood, having better capabilities there will probably open up some new possibilities.
- Legs: having my adjustable standing desk legs separate from the desk top has led to a few rounds of experimentation. You can just generally take and reattach the legs from lots of things.
- Plexiglass: I've mixed in a bit of plexi with some of my wood work. It's a little pricier, especially as you get thicker, so I only have thin stuff which in turn feels a little delicate when you stretch it over too great an area. Haven't quite got the feel for when to reach for it but I'll get there someday.
- Screens and keyboards: this is stretching a bit, but having lots of custom-built keyboards and random monitors around does encourage more weird computer constructions, and as long as you don't break them, they can be repurposed again and again.
