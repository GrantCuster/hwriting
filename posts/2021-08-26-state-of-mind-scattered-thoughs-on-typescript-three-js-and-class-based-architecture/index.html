  <h1>State of mind: scattered thoughs on Typescript, three.js, and class-based architecture</h1>
  <div><p>I&rsquo;m possibly in the midst of revising a bunch of my assumptions about how I like to code projects, so I wanted to write down my current thoughts. I&rsquo;m probably in a honeymoon phase with the new set-up, so it&rsquo;s possible as I work longer I&rsquo;ll run into a bunch of walls and complications and end up re-revising.</p>
<h2 id="typescript">Typescript</h2>
<p>I have been avoiding trying Typescript, but I&rsquo;ve now seen too much work from people working on involved interfaces (mainly Steve Ruiz&rsquo;s work and the Excalidraw project) to justify not at least trying it. So I&rsquo;ve been trying it on the new prototype and I think I like it. Barring running into some tremendous catch, I think I&rsquo;ll use it from here on out.</p>
<h2 id="combined-with-threejs">Combined with three.js</h2>
<p>I think a part of why I was prepared for Typescript was because I&rsquo;ve been using three.js a lot lately and gotten increasingly used to it&rsquo;s class based architecture for things like meshes and vectors. I got a lot more interested in the possibilities of Typescript when I realized it could help me create classes (or extend existing ones) to augment three.js with capabilities purpose-built for my project. The boundary between the library code and my code feels less set, which feels powerful to me.</p>
<h2 id="moving-away-from-the-dom">Moving away from the DOM</h2>
<p>Another contributing factor is that since the project I&rsquo;m working out is all in WebGL world, I don&rsquo;t have the DOM to organize around. Which has made organization using things like classes more important. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s an easy process, but rebuilding some of the things (like mouse over events) built into the DOM has been a good exercise in realizing that nothing is magic, and that the methods behind this kind of thing are approachable. I think it&rsquo;s also clarifying for me why things like the DOM and the javascript API are built the way they are. Decisions that seemed impenetrable before are now being revealed as a way to strike a balance between flexibility and organizational clarity.</p>
