  <h1>Low-stakes physical materials</h1>
  <div><p>Compared to digital constructions, there is a higher cost to starting over with physical work. But there are materials you can choose where it&rsquo;s much lower-stakes, and I&rsquo;ve been having fun assembling a set of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cardboard: a standby of prototyping, easily cut, surprisingly sturdy, readily available from shipping boxes, if cardboard wasn&rsquo;t so ubiquitous it would be a lot more appreciated. I at least do a first version on most things in cardboard, and often it lasts long enough that it stays cardboard. Goes great with hot glue but usually I just use tape.</li>
<li>Masking tape: good for cardboard, good for taping up inspiration, good for writing on with sharpie.</li>
<li>Air-drying clay: this a new one. I&rsquo;ve made some keyboard palm rests, a new housing for a wireless phone charger, and a holder for a set of cards. Not as nice looking as fired clay, it&rsquo;s still wonderful to be able to sit down with an idea and rough it out in 15 minutes. Clay gives you shapes cardboard and wood aren&rsquo;t friendly too.</li>
<li>Velco - I&rsquo;ve got rolls of velcro with adhesive on one side. Makes for easy keyboard and phone mounts.</li>
<li>Monitor poles and arms: I&rsquo;ve rearranged monitors so many times. Poles and the arms that go on them are generally modular and you can figure out ways to mount non-monitor things as well.  Most recently I used hose clamps to mount plywood panels flat against the poles. You can also get them in suprisingly tall sizes. If I were running a co-working space I&rsquo;d make walls out of them.</li>
<li>Plywood: wood requires a lot more tools and set-up. I&rsquo;ve got a decent set now, but I still try and set some constraints to not get bogged down in perfectionism. I got four sheets of 3/4&rdquo; birch from home depot a while ago, and they lasted me many years. Lately I&rsquo;ve taken to breaking down old under-used projects and reusing the wood, feels surprisingly satisfying. I try and keep it simple. Cut into rectangular shapes, mostly hold together with wood glue &ndash; screws when needed.</li>
<li>Hinges and connector plates: with the plywood I&rsquo;ve been venturing into hinges. Had a real &ldquo;there are no rules&rdquo; realization moment with the fact that you can just go buy hinges and make whatever kind of folding hinge-y thing you want. Starting to notice all the hinges around me.</li>
<li>Fabric and sewing: I&rsquo;ve done some bag modifications, often using the velcro. I think there&rsquo;s a lot more I could do here. Fabric, like clay, is a kind of differently shaped thing than cardboard and wood, having better capabilities there will probably open up some new possibilities.</li>
<li>Legs: having my adjustable standing desk legs separate from the desk top has led to a few rounds of experimentation. You can just generally take and reattach the legs from lots of things.</li>
<li>Plexiglass: I&rsquo;ve mixed in a bit of plexi with some of my wood work. It&rsquo;s a little pricier, especially as you get thicker, so I only have thin stuff which in turn feels a little delicate when you stretch it over too great an area. Haven&rsquo;t quite got the feel for when to reach for it but I&rsquo;ll get there someday.</li>
<li>Screens and keyboards: this is stretching a bit, but having lots of custom-built keyboards and random monitors around does encourage more weird computer constructions, and as long as you don&rsquo;t break them, they can be repurposed again and again.</li>
</ul>
