<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on building a task-focused operating system. Really it&rsquo;s more like a presentational wrapper on top of a bunch of Linux tools. You can see the configuration at <a href="https://github.com/GrantCuster/nix/tree/6e365d778b732395b8eb3968e9e70075f342a486">the repo</a>, for now it should only be used as a reference.</p>
<h2 id="the-idea">The idea</h2>
<p>The main idea is to have a separate workspace for each task. Workspaces are displayed on the home dashboard (accessed through Command+Tab). The workspace list is set-up similar to a command pallete: focused on being fast and keyboard-usable. Recently viewed spaces are at the top, typing filters them live, and hitting return selects the top one. You can create a new workspace directly from the filter input.</p>
<p>Currently workspaces themselves are pretty minimal. The workspace name is at the top left and the time at the top right. Application windows are tiled.</p>

</figure>
<p>The goal is to stay focused on one task at a time. I&rsquo;ve found just the step of having the task name in the bar to be surprisingly effective.</p>
<p>One piece that makes this work is that most of my applications are either terminals or browsers. I&rsquo;m quite happy to open multiple new terminals and browsers for each workspace. This keeps the workspaces self-contained (no need to flip back to refer to something in the browser in another space, just open a new browser window).</p>
<h2 id="the-architecture">The architecture</h2>
<ul>
<li>Operating system: Linux</li>
<li>Distribution: <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a> is an attempt to make your system set-up a lot more reproducible. It&rsquo;s not really essential to what I&rsquo;m doing in my set-up, but hopefully it will make it easier to maintain and branch. Most of my config is in <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager">home-manager</a> rather than the system config.</li>
<li>Window manager: <a href="https://hyprland.org/">Hyprland</a> is a relatively new tiling window manager and compositor. It&rsquo;s the basis for a lot of the customization I&rsquo;m able to do on my set-up. The command-line controls available through <code>hyprctrl</code> are what allow me to make custom interfaces. It&rsquo;s really nice that it has a JSON output option that makes it super easy to display info like current workspaces.</li>
<li>Window manager API: <a href="https://github.com/GrantCuster/nix/blob/main/home/home-ui/home-ui-server/server.mjs">Node.js websocket server</a>. This is, I think, where I get a bit more unconventional. I use a local websocket server to provide an interface to local web apps to command and display info from Hyprland by way of shell scripts. I also use this to send the contents of specific files (like my task list) on updates. I&rsquo;ve never run a websocket server before and I&rsquo;m sure optimizations could be made.</li>
<li>Custom <a href="https://github.com/GrantCuster/nix/blob/main/home/home-ui/home-ui-homepage/src/App.tsx">home dashboard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GrantCuster/nix/blob/main/home/home-ui/home-ui-bar/src/App.tsx">bar</a>: React web apps. Using the websocket server as a backend, I&rsquo;m able to make both a custom home dashboard and bar in React. By displaying them in chrome with the <code>app=</code> command-line flag, and Hyprland defined minimal window decorations, I&rsquo;m able to get rid of all the browser chrome, so they appear as stand-alone apps.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-react">Why React</h2>
<p>Mainly because it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m most familiar with and therefore can move the fastest and most surely in. There&rsquo;s also a pattern of apps like <a href="https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar">Waybar</a> adopting a subset of CSS for styling. Once I saw that and figured out the node.js to command-line piece, I thought why not just go all the way and get full access to HTML and CSS possibilities. My styling has stayed pretty minimalist so far, but there&rsquo;s obviously the potential to go much wilder with it.</p>
<p>The main concerns are latency and performance. I don&rsquo;t think performance is going to be hurt by keeping a few more web pages open. Latency I do feel a bit on clicks. I can&rsquo;t imagine React is the bottle-neck there, though, and probably I can get better results by tweaking my websocket and shell-script set-up.</p>
<h2 id="displaying-todos-and-screenshots">Displaying todos and screenshots</h2>
<p>I show lists of todos and system ideas on the dashboard as well. These come from markdown files, I again use the websocket server to <code>cat</code> the file contents and then display those within React. I could/should use a markdown renderer, but my todo format is consistent enough I just parse it myself for now. I use <code>inotify</code> to watch for changes and update automatically. This seems like a really interesting pattern I&rsquo;d like to experiment more with. Maybe make custom file watcher modules on the dashboard on-demand. In my case these files are also in my Obsidian vault, and since I have Obsidian sync I can get sync across my mobile devices too.</p>
<p>Screenshot display is similar but I watch a directory. The ability to display images (or videos) exactly like I want them is a really nice feature of doing this with HTML, and something I&rsquo;ll continue to explore.</p>
<h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>
<ul>
<li>Timers: the other big productivity and focus piece I want to get in is timers. I tried workspace timers but I think even that is a little inflexible. I think I want to make timers on demand as another custom web app. So that they can be workspace and task based or something else. I think I can also query across them to display a global view on the dashboard.</li>
<li>Scheduled workspaces: I want workspaces to show up for rituals I intend to do each day (like freewrite) this is definitely possible, just need to do more thinking about how I want to organize it.</li>
<li>Beyond tiling: I think having a task tied to one workspace works most of the time. But sometimes more windows than comfortably fit in the workspace are required. I can use the group and tabs feature for Hyprland to help with this, but I&rsquo;m also interested in trying some scrolling workspace solutions, similar to <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM">PaperWM</a>. Hyprland isn&rsquo;t exactly built for this, but I have some ideas of how to programatically make it work. The stretch version of this is a spatial canvas set-up.</li>
<li>Customizable dashboard: one thing I like about the current set-up is that modification is easy &ndash; I just run a dev version of the home app and develop it as I would a regular app. I think I want to try and shift even more abilities to customize into the home app itself, so I can switch out components, or even create new ones from the dashboard interface itself. If I find the right primitives I think this is totally possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="let-me-know-what-you-think">Let me know what you think</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested to hear from anyone doing similar experiments or what you would want if you were had your own customizable operating system.</p>
