  <h1>Towards more manageable pointer events</h1>
  <div><p>Working with mouse and touch events is one of the biggest challenges for me in making interactive web apps. The availability of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events">pointer events</a> helps a lot, but I still pretty quickly end up with a mess of conditionals that are hard to reason about. I&rsquo;m working on some new strategies and abstractions to help with this.</p>
<h2 id="pointerone-pointertwo-pointerthree">PointerOne, PointerTwo, PointerThree</h2>
<p>The pointer event API provides events for <code>pointerDown</code>, <code>pointerMove</code>, and <code>pointerUp</code>. Using the <code>pointerId</code> provided you can link those events together into a continuous Pointer object that contains the whole lifecycle. I put this together into a <code>SubPointer</code> class.</p>
<p>The <code>SubPointer</code>'s feed into another level of abstraction, based on how many active touches there are: <code>PointerOne</code>, <code>PointerTwo</code>, and <code>PointerThree</code>. This is meant to match how I think about these actions (&ldquo;I want to do this when the user has two fingers down&rdquo;). All of them feature fields for the <code>initial</code> and <code>current</code> pointer position. I use those values for things like drag (pan the canvas based on the distance between <code>current</code> and <code>initial</code>).</p>
<p>You can see code and a very barebones demo of this approach at <a href="https://github.com/GrantCuster/pointy">https://github.com/GrantCuster/pointy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="averaging-pointers">Averaging pointers</h3>
<p>Something I formalized in this set-up is the idea of average pointers. When two fingers are down I average their position to get the midpoint between them (same for three). This makes a lot of actions, like moving the canvas on two-finger drag and rotating the camera on three-finger drag, more straightforward to code. I can mostly just feed in the values from the average Pointer.</p>
<h3 id="managing-lifecycles">Managing lifecycles</h3>
<p>The separate pointer abstraction also helps me think more clearly about pointer continuity. When you add a second touch, the already-active first touch continues. But I think you generally want to throw away that first touch, and &lsquo;start from scratch&rsquo; with a new two-touch event. An example touch setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>One-finger drag: draw an area select</li>
<li>Two-finger drag: pan the canvas</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case when you move from one-finger to two-finger you want to end or cancel the one-finger drag action, and in terms of dragging, you want to reset the initial value to an average of both pointers&rsquo; current location. I work this out in the <code>SubPointer</code> class so that the <code>PointerOne</code> and <code>PointerTwo</code> behavior is exactly what I expect. Basically anytime the number of touches switch it ends the current Pointer and starts the new one. The logic in <code>SubPointer</code> still gets kind of gnarly but at least it&rsquo;s contained there. Overall I like the behavior of having a higher set of abstractions that, for my purposes &lsquo;just work&rsquo;, powered by a lower set of abstractions that I can dip into when I need to.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-mouse-buttons">Keyboard mouse buttons</h2>
<p>Another big driver of complexity in my input management is keyboard events and modifiers. Modifying the pointer behavior based on a pressed key is often intuitive to the user but will snarl your pointer handling code quickly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m experimenting with an approach based on how the pointer events work. The trick here again turns out to be about managing lifecycles.</p>
<p>If you have a key that modifies pointer behavior you need to think about how you&rsquo;re going to handle a user starting a pointer event then pressing the key, then unpressing the key, all while the touch is still active. I decided to just &lsquo;interrupt&rsquo; the current touch behavior and restart it. That way I only need to check for the relevant keypress on <code>PointerOne</code>'s start and move events. My conditionals in those events are still growing larger than I&rsquo;d like, but at least they&rsquo;re contained and easier to reason about.</p>
<p>In effect this approach is turning key presses into <code>pointerDown</code> (and <code>pointerUp</code>) events. It&rsquo;s early days but so far this approach has it made it much easier for me to reason about key and pointer combos.</p>
