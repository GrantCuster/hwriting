<title>Bushido Blade 2: a design appreciation - Grant Custer</title>

  <h1>Bushido Blade 2: a design appreciation</h1>
  <div><p>Bushido Blade 2 was a Playstation game I played a lot in high school.

<p>Design-wise, Bushido Blade rethought the premise of a fighting game from first principles. I love what this approach allowed them to do in terms of immersion: during a fight, nothing is visible on the screen except the two characters.</p>
<p>This is what I want to do when I design something: communicate everything through the core action. Design things so well that you don&rsquo;t need to bring in health bars and labels.</p>
<p>Bushido Blade 2, like most of the games I played, was well-reviewed but never really that popular. I remember it having a pretty good story-mode with fun voice acting.</p>
