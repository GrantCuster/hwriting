<title>What did Pokemon do? - Grant Custer</title>
<meta property="description" content="Pokemon took the combat formula from traditional turn-based RPGs and turned it inside-out.
In traditional RPGs you have a few characters who learn more and more attacks and spells.
In Pokemon you capture more and more characters (pokemon) who can only have four moves each.
Instead of choosing from a big list of attacks and spells, you choose from a list of Pokemon and then a small list of moves.">

  <h1>What did Pokemon do?</h1>
  <div><p>Pokemon took the combat formula from traditional turn-based RPGs and turned it inside-out.</p>
<p>In traditional RPGs you have a few characters who learn more and more attacks and spells.</p>
<p>In Pokemon you capture more and more characters (pokemon) who can only have four moves each.</p>
<p>Instead of choosing from a big list of attacks and spells, you choose from a list of Pokemon and then a small list of moves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in the shift from &ldquo;few characters, many moves&rdquo; to &ldquo;many characters, few moves each&rdquo; as a design move that could be useful to apply to interfaces.</p>
<p>Many traditional RPGs (I&rsquo;ve been playing Chrono Trigger) are recognized as some of the best videogames ever made, but they don&rsquo;t rival pokemon in popularity.</p>
<p>How much can you put that difference down to the shift in combat? There are definitely some other, related aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capturing means regular battles are now opportunities to create more characters. Regular battles are the grindiest aspects of RPGs so this seems like a big deal.</li>
<li>Evolution mechanics tap into people&rsquo;s interest in digital pets.</li>
</ul>
